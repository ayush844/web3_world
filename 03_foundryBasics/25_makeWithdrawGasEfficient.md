---

## üí° The Core Problem: Storage is Expensive

From the previous lesson, you learned that **storage operations (`SLOAD` and `SSTORE`)** are the **most expensive operations** in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Let‚Äôs remind ourselves of the relative costs:

| Opcode   | Operation         | Type    | Min Gas Cost                     |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `MLOAD`  | Read from memory  | Memory  | ~3 gas                           |
| `MSTORE` | Write to memory   | Memory  | ~3 gas                           |
| `SLOAD`  | Read from storage | Storage | ~100 gas                         |
| `SSTORE` | Write to storage  | Storage | ~20,000 gas (if zero ‚Üí non-zero) |

So reading or writing from **storage** is roughly **33x to 6,000x more expensive** than using **memory**.

---

### üîç Why Does This Matter?

In Solidity, **state variables** (declared outside functions) live in **storage**.
Local variables (inside functions) live in **memory** or **stack** ‚Äî both are cheap.

So whenever you repeatedly read a state variable inside a loop,
you‚Äôre doing **multiple `SLOAD`s**, which cost a lot of gas.

---

## üß± The Original `withdraw()` Problem

The original `withdraw()` function in your `FundMe.sol` looked something like this:

```solidity
function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 funderIndex = 0; funderIndex < s_funders.length; funderIndex++) {
        address funder = s_funders[funderIndex];
        s_addressToAmountFunded[funder] = 0;
    }
    s_funders = new address ;

    (bool callSuccess,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(callSuccess, "Call failed");
}
```

Looks fine, right?

But notice the **loop condition**:

```solidity
funderIndex < s_funders.length
```

Each time the loop runs, the EVM executes an `SLOAD` to fetch `s_funders.length` from storage.

If there are **1000 funders**, we‚Äôll perform **1000 `SLOAD` operations** just to read the same length ‚Äî wasting gas unnecessarily.

---

## üß† The Optimization: Cache in Memory

The fix is simple but powerful ‚Äî **cache storage reads in a local variable**.

```solidity
function cheaperWithdraw() public onlyOwner {
    uint256 fundersLength = s_funders.length; // Cached in memory
    for (uint256 funderIndex = 0; funderIndex < fundersLength; funderIndex++) {
        address funder = s_funders[funderIndex];
        s_addressToAmountFunded[funder] = 0;
    }
    s_funders = new address ;

    (bool callSuccess,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(callSuccess, "Call failed");
}
```

---

### üß© What We Did

| Operation                             | Storage vs Memory                            | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `s_funders.length`                    | **Read once from storage ‚Üí store in memory** | Saves one `SLOAD` per loop iteration |
| `funder = s_funders[funderIndex]`     | Still a storage read (unavoidable)           | We must read each address            |
| `s_addressToAmountFunded[funder] = 0` | Still a storage write (unavoidable)          | We must reset mappings               |
| `s_funders = new address `            | Storage write                                | Resets the array                     |
| ETH transfer                          | External call                                | Necessary operation                  |

The only change ‚Äî **one line of caching** ‚Äî
but it prevents **N redundant storage reads** where **N = number of funders**.

---

## üî¨ Understanding Why It Works

The EVM works at a very low level:

* Every time you read `s_funders.length`, it executes an `SLOAD` from storage.
* Each `SLOAD` can cost ~2,100‚Äì2,600 gas depending on context.

By doing:

```solidity
uint256 fundersLength = s_funders.length;
```

We read it once (1 √ó `SLOAD`),
store it in **memory** (cheap),
and reuse it **N times for free**.

If `N = 1000`, that‚Äôs roughly **1000 √ó 2,100 = 2.1 million gas saved** in large loops.

Even though your test shows smaller differences (since test data is small),
in real contracts with large user bases, **this optimization scales dramatically**.

---

## üßÆ Running Gas Comparison Tests

We now want to measure exactly how much we saved.

---

### üß± Add `cheaperWithdraw()` to FundMe.sol

```solidity
function cheaperWithdraw() public onlyOwner {
    uint256 fundersLength = s_funders.length;
    for (uint256 funderIndex = 0; funderIndex < fundersLength; funderIndex++) {
        address funder = s_funders[funderIndex];
        s_addressToAmountFunded[funder] = 0;
    }
    s_funders = new address ;

    (bool callSuccess,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(callSuccess, "Call failed");
}
```

---

### üß™ Add Test in FundMe.t.sol

Copy your old test for `withdraw()` and modify it:

```solidity
function testWithdrawFromMultipleFundersCheaper() public funded {
    uint160 numberOfFunders = 10;
    uint160 startingFunderIndex = 1;
    for (uint160 i = startingFunderIndex; i < numberOfFunders + startingFunderIndex; i++) {
        // Foundry's `hoax` gives ETH and pranks an address
        hoax(address(i), SEND_VALUE);
        fundMe.fund{value: SEND_VALUE}();
    }

    uint256 startingFundMeBalance = address(fundMe).balance;
    uint256 startingOwnerBalance = fundMe.getOwner().balance;

    vm.startPrank(fundMe.getOwner());
    fundMe.cheaperWithdraw();
    vm.stopPrank();

    assert(address(fundMe).balance == 0);
    assert(startingFundMeBalance + startingOwnerBalance == fundMe.getOwner().balance);
    assert((numberOfFunders + 1) * SEND_VALUE == fundMe.getOwner().balance - startingOwnerBalance);
}
```

---

### üßæ Run Snapshot Command

```bash
forge snapshot
```

---

### üìä Output (Example)

```
FundMeTest:testWithdrawFromMultipleFunders() (gas: 535148)
FundMeTest:testWithdrawFromMultipleFundersCheaper() (gas: 534219)
```

‚úÖ **Saved 929 gas** just by caching one variable.

That might seem small here, but remember:

* We only tested 10 funders.
* Real protocols may have thousands ‚Üí savings scale linearly.

## üß† Why This Optimization Matters

| Concept                               | Explanation                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage reads are slow and costly** | Each `SLOAD` pulls data from disk-level persistent storage |
| **Memory is cheap**                   | RAM-like structure used only during execution              |
| **Caching**                           | Store storage data once into memory and reuse it           |
| **Gas savings scale with usage**      | The more iterations, the more gas saved                    |

This optimization technique is called **‚Äúcaching storage reads‚Äù** ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of the simplest yet most effective Solidity performance tricks.

---

## üß© What You Can‚Äôt Avoid

Not all storage access can be eliminated. For example:

* Reading each funder‚Äôs address (`s_funders[i]`)
* Resetting each funder‚Äôs contribution mapping (`s_addressToAmountFunded[funder]`)
* Clearing the array and transferring ETH

These are **necessary SLOAD/SSTORE operations**.
But any **repeated or constant reads** (like `.length`, `.owner`, `.balance`)
should be **cached** locally whenever possible.

---

## üß† Additional Techniques for Cheaper Withdrawals

Here are more ways to optimize gas consumption in such functions:

| Technique                             | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use `memory` for temporary arrays** | Copy storage array to memory before looping to reduce repeated `SLOAD`s.                                        |
| **Batch processing**                  | Split large loops into multiple smaller transactions (useful for huge funder lists).                            |
| **Unchecked increments**              | Use `unchecked { funderIndex++; }` inside loop if you know overflow is impossible.                              |
| **Avoid redundant state updates**     | Don‚Äôt zero out mappings/arrays if you‚Äôre redeploying anyway.                                                    |
| **Use `delete` keyword**              | Instead of reassigning a new empty array (`new address `), `delete s_funders` resets storage slots efficiently. |

---

### üß© Example of Using Memory Array (Even Cheaper)

```solidity
function evenCheaperWithdraw() public onlyOwner {
    address[] memory funders = s_funders; // Copy to memory
    uint256 fundersLength = funders.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < fundersLength; i++) {
        s_addressToAmountFunded[funders[i]] = 0;
    }
    delete s_funders; // Equivalent to resetting array
    (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success, "Call failed");
}
```

Here we:

* Copy the entire `s_funders` array to memory once.
* Loop through the memory array (cheap reads).
* Write only once per funder to mapping (storage write, unavoidable).
* Use `delete` instead of `new address ` (slightly cheaper reset).

This version will likely save **more gas** when funders count grows large.

## üßæ Style Guide & Naming Conventions

The `s_`, `i_`, and constant naming style isn‚Äôt just aesthetic ‚Äî
it helps you **visually separate storage, immutable, and constant variables**:

| Prefix     | Type      | Lifetime               | Example                    |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `s_`       | Storage   | Persistent             | `s_funders`, `s_priceFeed` |
| `i_`       | Immutable | Set once (constructor) | `i_owner`                  |
| `ALL_CAPS` | Constant  | Compile-time fixed     | `MINIMUM_USD`              |

This naming scheme lets you instantly spot where optimizations are possible:

* `s_` ‚Üí slow, storage read/write ‚Üí expensive.
* `memory` or local ‚Üí cheap, reuse freely.
* `constant` ‚Üí zero gas (baked in bytecode).

## üß© Quick Visual: Gas Comparison

| Function            | Gas (Tested with 10 funders) | Improvement         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `withdraw()`        | 535,148                      | ‚Äî                   |
| `cheaperWithdraw()` | 534,219                      | ‚Üì **929 gas saved** |
