# 🚀 Deploying Smart Contracts to Testnet or Mainnet using Foundry & Alchemy

## 🧠 Overview

In this guide, we’ll learn how to:

* Deploy a Solidity smart contract to a **testnet or live network** using **Foundry**.
* Set up **Alchemy** as our RPC provider.
* Use **MetaMask** for the private key.
* **Verify the contract** on Etherscan.
* **Clean up** and format the project for better readability.

---

## 🌐 Setting Up for Deployment

### 1. Update the `.env` File

To deploy to a real test network (like **Sepolia**), we need:

* A **testnet RPC URL** (from Alchemy)
* A **private key** (from MetaMask)

> MetaMask’s built-in Infura URLs can’t be directly used with Foundry, so we’ll create our own RPC endpoint using **Alchemy**.

---

## 🔗 Creating a Testnet RPC URL (via Alchemy)

### Steps:

1. Go to [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) and **sign up** (Google sign-in works fine).
2. Create a **new app** — for example, name it *“Sepolia Testing”*.
3. Choose:

   * **Network:** Ethereum
   * **Chain:** Sepolia Testnet
4. Skip the advanced options.
5. Once created, click **“View Key”** to get your **HTTPS endpoint**.
   → This acts just like a Ganache or MetaMask endpoint.

---

## 🔑 Setting the Private Key

### Why we need this:

* Ganache private keys don’t have testnet ETH.
* We’ll use a MetaMask account that has Sepolia ETH.

### Steps:

1. Open MetaMask → Switch to **Sepolia Testnet**.
2. Choose an account with testnet ETH.
3. Click **Account Details → Export Private Key**.
4. Enter your password to reveal the key.
5. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file like this:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
Sepolia_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_api_key
```

⚠️ **Never share your real private key!**
Use it only in local development or test environments.

---

## ⚙️ Deploying the Contract

Now that everything is set, let’s deploy!

```bash
source .env
forge script script/deploySimpleStorage.s.sol \
--rpc-url=$Sepolia_RPC_URL \
--private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY \
--broadcast
```

✅ This command:

* Compiles and deploys your contract to **Sepolia**.
* Broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain.
* You can monitor it in your **Alchemy Dashboard**.

### Verify Deployment

* Copy the **transaction hash** from the terminal.
* Paste it into [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) to confirm the deployment.
* Refresh Alchemy’s dashboard to see the **requests and raw transactions**.

---

## 🧾 Verifying the Contract on Etherscan (Manual Way)

Once your contract is deployed, you’ll see only **bytecode** on Etherscan.
Let’s make it human-readable!

### Steps to Verify:

1. On Etherscan, click **“Verify and Publish”**.
2. Contract address will be auto-filled (paste it if not).
3. Set these options:

   * **Compiler Type:** Solidity (Single File)
   * **Compiler Version:** `0.8.19`
   * **License:** MIT
4. Paste your Solidity code in the text box.
5. Enable **Optimization → Yes**.
6. Submit and wait for confirmation.

If you see:

```
Successfully generated Bytecode and ABI for Contract Address [0x...]
```
### OR

```bash
forge verify-contract 0x5258D0079eA5c8FB1A22bf0d27a38cBb032B11fa src/SimpleStorage.sol:SimpleStorage --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --chain sepolia --verifier etherscan --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```


🎉 You did it!

Now you can use:

* **Read Contract** → View public variables/functions.
* **Write Contract** → Interact directly via Etherscan UI.

## 🧹 Cleaning Up the Project

### 1. Consistent Formatting

Use Foundry’s built-in formatter:

```bash
forge fmt
```

This ensures all Solidity files follow the same coding style.

---

### 2. Adding a README.md

A `README.md` helps others understand and contribute to your project.

#### Example:

````markdown
# SimpleStorage

A simple Solidity contract that stores a single uint256 value.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Foundry → [Foundry Installation Guide](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
3. Compile the contract:
   ```bash
   forge build
````

4. Deploy to a test network:

   ```bash
   forge create
   ```
5. Interact via Forge console:

   ```bash
   forge console
   ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!
Open an issue or submit a pull request to improve this project.

To preview your README in VS Code:
> Go to `View → Open Preview to the Side`

### 💡 Tip: Use AI for Markdown Formatting
If you find Markdown tedious, tools like **ChatGPT** can format it for you.  
Just paste your raw text and ask for Markdown formatting — review and edit as needed.
