# 🔧 Refactoring Code & Tests — FundMe (Foundry)

## 🎯 Goal

Make the project **modular and flexible** so it’s easy to deploy to different chains (Anvil, Sepolia, mainnet, Arbitrum, etc.) without copy-pasting chain-specific addresses throughout the code.

---

## ❗ Problem

`FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol` used a **hardcoded Chainlink Aggregator address** (`0x694A...5306`) (Sepolia). That prevents deploying to other chains or local test nodes.

---

## ✅ Solution: Move chain-specific data into constructor (refactor)

**Refactor approach:** replace hardcoded addresses with a `s_priceFeed` state variable and pass the price feed address into the constructor. Update library functions to accept the `priceFeed` as an argument.

---

## 📦 Code Changes — `FundMe.sol`

### 1. Add state variable

```solidity
AggregatorV3Interface private s_priceFeed;
```

### 2. Constructor takes priceFeed address

```solidity
constructor(address priceFeed) {
    i_owner = msg.sender;
    s_priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeed);
}
```

### 3. Update `getVersion()` to use `s_priceFeed`

```solidity
function getVersion() public view returns (uint256) {
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(s_priceFeed);
    return priceFeed.version();
}
```

### 4. Update `fund()` to pass `s_priceFeed` into conversion

Wherever you call the conversion utility:

```solidity
getConversionRate(msg.value, s_priceFeed)
```

(or similar depending on your function names)

---

## 📚 Code Changes — `PriceConverter.sol` (library)

### 1. `getPrice` signature — accept priceFeed

```solidity
function getPrice(AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // use priceFeed (no hardcoded address)
    ...
}
```

**Remove** the hardcoded `AggregatorV3Interface(0x694A...)` line.

### 2. `getConversionRate` signature — accept priceFeed and forward it

```solidity
function getConversionRate(
    uint256 ethAmount,
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 ethPrice = getPrice(priceFeed);
    uint256 ethAmountInUsd = (ethPrice * ethAmount) / 1e18;
    return ethAmountInUsd;
}
```

---

## 🧭 What to update across project

* Update **all calls** to `getPrice`/`getConversionRate` to pass the `AggregatorV3Interface` or the `s_priceFeed`.
* Update any other helper functions that relied on the hardcoded address.
* Update constructor calls where `FundMe` is deployed to include a priceFeed address.

---

## 🛠️ Deploy Script — `script/DeployFundMe.s.sol`

Update `run()` to **pass the price feed address** when creating `FundMe`:

```solidity
function run() external returns (FundMe) {
    vm.startBroadcast();
    FundMe fundMe = new FundMe(0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306);
    vm.stopBroadcast();
    return fundMe;
}
```

* `run()` now **returns** the deployed `FundMe` instance.
* For now you hardcode Sepolia address here (temporary). Later make this dynamic by reading chain ID or an env var.

---

## 🧪 Tests — `test/FundMe.t.sol`

### 1. Import deploy script

```solidity
import {DeployFundMe} from "../script/DeployFundMe.s.sol";
```

### 2. Declare state variable

```solidity
DeployFundMe deployFundMe;
FundMe fundMe;
```

### 3. Update `setUp()` to use the deploy script

```solidity
function setUp() external {
    deployFundMe = new DeployFundMe();
    fundMe = deployFundMe.run();
}
```

This makes tests deploy `FundMe` **the same way your script does**, and uses the returned instance.

---

## 🧩 Important: Owner change & `vm.startBroadcast`

### The subtle issue

* Previously, when you deployed `FundMe` **directly in `setUp()`** using `new FundMe()`, the test contract (`address(this)`) was the deployer → owner was `address(this)`.
* After refactor, deployment goes through the **DeployFundMe** script using `vm.startBroadcast()` — the effective deployer becomes the address used by `vm.startBroadcast()` (which can be the test runner's configured address or the private key passed to the script), **not** `address(this)`.

### Consequence

Your test `testOwnerIsMsgSender()` that asserted owner equals `address(this)` or `msg.sender` may fail depending on how `vm.startBroadcast()` behaves.

* `vm.startBroadcast()` uses the signer/private key configured for broadcasting. When used from the deploy script called by the test, the deployer changes.

---

## 🔧 Final test adjustment (as requested in your flow)

To account for `vm.startBroadcast()` behavior, change the owner assertion in the test to match the expected deployer. In your walkthrough you end by saying:

> To account for the way vm.startBroadcast works please perform the following modification in FundMe.t.sol:
>
> ```
> function testOwnerIsMsgSender() public {
>     assertEq(fundMe.i_owner(), msg.sender);
> }
> ```

So run the tests again with the fork:

```bash
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

If the test still fails, print logs (or assert against `address(this)` or the specific broadcast address) to see which address is the actual owner.

---

## 🧪 Debugging tips (when owner/assertion fails)

* Use `console.log(fundMe.i_owner()); console.log(msg.sender);` to see values.
* `address(this)` in a test is the test contract’s address.
* `msg.sender` inside a test function is the test execution context address.
* When using `vm.startBroadcast()` in scripts, the deployer becomes the broadcast signer.
* If you want `address(this)` to be the owner, deploy directly in `setUp()` with `new FundMe(...)`. If you want to test the real deploy script behavior, keep using the script and assert against the expected broadcast address.

---

## 🧾 Recap: Steps you performed

1. Identified hardcoded address problem.
2. Refactored `FundMe.sol` to accept a `priceFeed` in constructor and store it in `s_priceFeed`.
3. Modified `PriceConverter.sol` functions to accept `priceFeed`.
4. Updated `fund()` and other callers to pass `s_priceFeed`.
5. Updated deploy script to call `new FundMe(priceFeedAddr)` and return the instance.
6. Updated test `setUp()` to use the deploy script `deployFundMe.run()` and assign `fundMe`.
7. Ran tests using a fork (`--fork-url`) to validate Chainlink address behavior.
8. Debugged failing owner test by understanding `vm.startBroadcast()` behavior and adjusting the assertion.

---

## ✅ Best practices & next steps

* **Don't hardcode addresses**. Use constructor args or a deployment config that maps chain IDs → addresses.
* Make deployment scripts **dynamic**:

  * Read chainId via `block.chainid` or set via env variables.
  * Pass appropriate price feed addresses depending on chainId.
* For tests:

  * Use **forked tests** only when necessary (e.g., when real on-chain contracts are required). Use `--mt` to run a specific test.
  * Use `vm.prank` / `vm.startBroadcast` intentionally and be explicit about what deployer/signer you expect.
* Replace hardcoded Sepolia addresses in deploy script and tests with **constants** or a `helper-config` file to reduce duplication.
* Add tests that assert correct behavior across networks by parameterizing the test inputs.
