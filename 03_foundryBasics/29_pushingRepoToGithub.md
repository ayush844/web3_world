# üöÄ Pushing to GitHub

---

## üéâ Introduction

Congratulations on reaching this far!
One of the most important parts of development is **sharing your work** so others can see it, contribute, or learn from it.

Even if you prefer to work solo, you still need a **version control system** ‚Äî a way to save and revisit different stages of your project easily.

That‚Äôs where **Git** and **GitHub** come in.

---

## üß© Preparing Your Project

Before doing anything else, make sure your **`.gitignore`** file includes sensitive and unnecessary files, especially:

* `.env` (to avoid pushing private keys)
* Deployment logs
* Local build and cache files

### ‚úÖ Example `.gitignore`

```gitignore
# Compiler files
cache/
out/

# Ignore development broadcast logs
!/broadcast
/broadcast/*/31337/
/broadcast/**/dry-run/
/broadcast/

# Docs
docs/

# Environment variables
.env

# Libraries
/lib

# Local keystore
.keystore
```

## üß† Why GitHub?

GitHub isn‚Äôt just a hosting platform ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **social coding network** where you can:

* üßë‚Äçüíª Host your repositories
* üõ†Ô∏è Collaborate on open-source projects
* ü™Ñ Contribute to others‚Äô work (forks, pull requests)
* üì£ Build a strong portfolio for job applications

> A good GitHub profile can open up real-world opportunities!

If you don‚Äôt yet have a GitHub account, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Checking Git Installation

In your terminal, run:

```bash
git version
```

If you see something like:

```
git version 2.34.1
```

‚úÖ Git is installed.

If not, follow the official installation guide:
üëâ [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

---

## üß± Initializing Git in Your Project

1. Navigate to your project‚Äôs **root directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. Initialize a Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init -b main
   ```

   Output (if Foundry already created one):

   ```
   warning: re-init: ignored --initial-branch=main
   Reinitialized existing Git repository in ...
   ```

---

## üìä Checking Your Git Status

Run:

```bash
git status
```

You should see output like:

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

If `.env` appears in the tracked files list ‚ùå
‚Üí You must add it to `.gitignore` before committing!

---

## üß© Staging and Committing Files

### Stage all files:

```bash
git add .
```

### Check what‚Äôs staged:

```bash
git status
```

You‚Äôll notice a ‚ÄúChanges to be committed‚Äù section with your staged files in **green**.

---

### Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "our first commit!"
```

### View commit history:

```bash
git log
```

Example output:

```
commit c3cd23888f84531a9a7a7a0c4e2070039a7a0b63 (HEAD -> main)
Author: InAllHonesty <inallhonesty92@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed May 15 12:49:50 2024 +0300

    our first commit!
```

‚úÖ Git has now saved a snapshot of your project locally.

---

## üß† What Is Version Control?

Version control allows you to:

* Track changes over time
* Revert to older versions
* See who made specific changes
* Collaborate safely with others

`git log` shows commit history ‚Äî each commit is a ‚Äúversion‚Äù of your project.

---

## üåê Uploading to GitHub

### 1. Create a Repository

* Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com)**
* Click ‚ûï ‚Üí **New Repository**
* Give it a **name** and optional **description**
* Make it **public**
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt add a README or `.gitignore` (you already have them)
* Click **Create Repository**

---

### 2. Connect Local Repo to GitHub

Copy the HTTPS link from your new repository (e.g.):

```
https://github.com/yourusername/fundMe-lesson.git
```

Then in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/fundMe-lesson.git
```

Check your remote:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Output:

```
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/fundMe-lesson.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/fundMe-lesson.git (push)
```

---

### 3. Push Your Code

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This uploads your code to GitHub on the `main` branch.

If errors occur (e.g., authentication or permissions), you can:

* Copy the error and paste it into ChatGPT for troubleshooting
* Or ask in the **Cyfrin Discord ‚Äì Updraft** section

---

### 4. Verify on GitHub

Go back to your repository page and refresh.

‚úÖ Your code is now **live on GitHub!**

---

## üßæ Updating Files

Let‚Äôs update the `README.md`:

1. Edit it in VS Code ‚Äî add:

   * Project title
   * Description
   * Requirements
   * Quick start guide

2. Save the file, then run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update the README.md file"
git push origin main
```

Refresh your GitHub repo ‚Äî your updated README should appear!

---

## üß¨ Cloning Repositories

The `git clone` command is used to **copy** a remote repository to your local system.

### Example:

If you want to clone:

```
https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-10-PasswordStore
```

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-10-PasswordStore.git
```

This creates a new folder named `2023-10-PasswordStore` in your current directory.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Open the Project in VS Code

```bash
cd 2023-10-PasswordStore
code .
```

Now you can explore or modify the project locally!
