* You’ll also use **cast** (Foundry CLI tool) to interact with deployed contracts.

---

## 🏗️ **Project Setup**

### 🗂️ Repository & Folder Setup

Open your terminal in the `foundry-f23` folder.
You should see only the `foundry-simple-storage-f23` folder from the previous section.

Now, let’s create a new project folder for Fund Me:

```bash
mkdir foundry-fund-me-f23
cd foundry-fund-me-f23
code .
```

* `mkdir` → Creates a new folder
* `cd` → Navigates into it
* `code .` → Opens the folder in VS Code

---

## 🧱 **Creating a New Foundry Project**

Once inside the new folder, initialize a new Foundry project.

```bash
forge init
```

If the folder isn’t empty, use:

```bash
forge init --force
```

This will automatically generate:

* `src/Counter.sol` → Example smart contract
* `script/Counter.s.sol` → Example deploy script
* `test/Counter.t.sol` → Example test file

---

## 📘 **Analyzing the Default Counter Contract**

### 🔹 **Counter.sol**

A simple contract that:

* Stores a number (`uint256 number`)
* Has two functions:

  ```solidity
  function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public { number = newNumber; }
  function increment() public { number++; } // same as number = number + 1
  ```

### 🔹 **Counter.s.sol**

* Placeholder deployment script (currently does nothing)

### 🔹 **Counter.t.sol**

* A **test file** for the contract
* This is where all automated tests will be written going forward.

---

## 🧪 **Running Tests**

To execute all the tests:

```bash
forge test
```

This command:

* Compiles all contracts
* Finds all test files in the `/test` folder
* Runs all functions starting with `test`

The output shows:

* 🧩 Number of tests found
* 📄 File names
* ✅ Pass/fail status
* 🧾 Summary report

---

### ⚙️ **How `forge test` Works**

* Foundry looks inside the `/test` folder.
* It runs the `setUp()` function (if present) before executing tests.
* Then, it executes all **public/external functions** whose names start with `test`.
* Each test contains **assert statements**.

  * If all `assert` statements return true → ✅ Test passes
  * If any `assert` statement fails → ❌ Test fails

Example:

```solidity
function testSetNumber() public {
    counter.setNumber(42);
    assertEq(counter.number(), 42);
}
```

---

## 🔍 **Explore Test Options**

You can explore all testing options using:

```bash
forge test --help
```

This displays:

* Test configuration options
* Result display preferences
* Environment settings
* Advanced parameters like fuzzing, gas reporting, etc.

📚 You can read more in the **Foundry Book** to learn about testing in detail.

---

## 💾 **Understanding Storage in Fund Me**

In this section, you’ll dive deeper into:

* How **storage variables** and **state** work internally
* Why we use naming conventions like:

  * `FundMe__NotOwner()` → Custom error naming style
  * `ALL_CAPS` → Constants
  * `i_variableName` → Immutable variables
  * `s_variableName` → Private state variables

These naming patterns improve **readability**, **gas efficiency**, and **code professionalism**.

---

## 💡 **Contracts Referenced**

* **FundMe.sol** — main funding contract
* **FunWithStorage.sol** — used to explore how Solidity manages storage slots
* **cast** — Foundry command-line tool to interact directly with smart contracts

---

# ⚙️ **Finishing the Setup (Fund Me Project)**

After initializing our new Foundry project, let’s complete the setup for the **Fund Me** contract.

---

## 🧹 Step 1: Clean the Default Files

Delete the default **Counter** files that Foundry generated during project initialization.
You can remove the following files:

```
src/Counter.sol
script/Counter.s.sol
test/Counter.t.sol
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create New Contract Files

In the **`src`** folder, create two new files:

```
FundMe.sol
PriceConverter.sol
```

Then, go to the **Remix Fund Me repository** and **copy the contents** of both contracts into these new files.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Try Compiling

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
forge compile
```

or

```bash
forge build
```

You’ll likely encounter a few **errors** — let’s see why.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Understanding the Compilation Error

Open the contracts you just copied and look at the top import statement:

```solidity
import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
```

This works fine in **Remix**, because Remix **automatically handles dependencies** for you.

However, in **Foundry**, you must **manually install all external dependencies** (such as Chainlink).

---

## 📦 Step 5: Installing Dependencies

Foundry uses the `forge install` command to install dependencies.

We’ll install the **Chainlink contracts** library manually.

Run this command:

```bash
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@1.3.0
```

> 🧠 Here’s what this command means:
>
> * `smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts` → GitHub repository
> * `@1.3.0` → Specifies the version tag to install
> * *(No `--no-commit` this time — we’re allowing Forge to create a commit for dependency installation)*

Wait for the installation to finish.

---

## 🧭 Step 6: Verifying Installation

After installation, open your **`lib`** folder.
You should now see:

```
lib/
 ├── forge-std/                      (auto-installed by forge init)
 └── chainlink-brownie-contracts/    (just installed)
```

Inside `chainlink-brownie-contracts`, navigate to:

```
contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol
```

This is the **interface** we’re importing in `FundMe.sol`.

---

## 🧩 Step 7: Fixing Import Paths with Remappings

You may have noticed that in your contract, the import path uses:

```solidity
@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol
```

But the actual path on your machine is:

```
lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol
```

So how does Foundry know what `@chainlink` means?
👉 Through a **remapping** defined in `foundry.toml`.

---

### 🛠️ Add Remappings in `foundry.toml`

Open your **`foundry.toml`** file and scroll to the `[profile.default]` section.
Below it, add the following line:

```toml
remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
```

This tells Foundry:

> “Whenever you see `@chainlink/contracts/`, replace it with `lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/`.”

---

## 🧪 Step 8: Recompile

Now that the remapping is set, run the compilation again:

```bash
forge compile
```

or

```bash
forge build
```

🎉 **Success! Everything compiles now.**

---

## 💬 Developer Insight

Fixing dependencies is one of the **most tedious parts** of smart contract development and auditing.
When dealing with import errors or mismatched versions, keep these best practices in mind:

### ✅ **Dependency Management Tips**

* Choose the **correct GitHub repository path**.
* Specify **exact version tags** (like `@1.3.0`) for reproducibility.
* Always verify **remappings** inside `foundry.toml`.
* Recompile after each change to confirm everything works.

---

## ✅ **Summary**

| Step | Action                                 | Command                                                                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Delete Counter files                   | —                                                                                   |
| 2    | Create FundMe.sol & PriceConverter.sol | —                                                                                   |
| 3    | Compile project                        | `forge compile`                                                                     |
| 4    | Install dependencies                   | `forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@1.3.0`                  |
| 5    | Add remapping                          | `remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']` |
| 6    | Recompile to verify                    | `forge build`                                                                       |

---

### 💡 Quick Recap

* Remix handles dependencies automatically → Foundry doesn’t.
* Use `forge install` to manually add required libraries.
* `foundry.toml` **remappings** help Foundry locate imports correctly.
* Once dependencies and remappings are fixed → **your project compiles successfully.**
