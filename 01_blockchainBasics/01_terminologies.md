### **1. Bitcoin (BTC)**

* **Technically:** A peer-to-peer payment system where transactions are recorded in a **public blockchain** (Proof of Work consensus).
* **Ledger structure:** Every transaction is grouped into a block. Each block references the previous one using a **hash** ‚Üí forming an immutable chain.
* **Security:** Miners solve cryptographic puzzles (hashing with SHA-256) to add new blocks ‚Üí prevents double-spending.
* **Limitation:** Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language is very limited ‚Üí mainly for money transfer, not complex logic.

---

### **2. Ethereum (ETH)**

* **Technically:** A **general-purpose blockchain** with a built-in **Turing-complete programming language** (Solidity).
* **Consensus:** Transitioned from Proof of Work ‚Üí Proof of Stake (Ethereum 2.0).
* **Gas fees:** Every operation has a computational cost, paid in ETH (‚Äúgas‚Äù). Prevents spam and ensures resource usage is fairly allocated.
* **Strength:** Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is like a **world computer** that can execute arbitrary logic (via smart contracts).

---

### **3. Smart Contract**

* **Technically:** A program stored at a blockchain address, executed deterministically by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
* **State & Functions:**

  * **State variables** (stored on-chain, like a database).
  * **Functions** (operations users can call).
* **Determinism:** Same input ‚Üí same output ‚Üí ensures all blockchain nodes agree.
* **Example:** ERC-20 token contract defines balances and transfers.

---

### **4. Blockchain**

* **Data structure:** A linked list of blocks ‚Üí each block contains:

  * Block header (hash of previous block, timestamp, nonce).
  * Transaction list.
* **Consensus mechanism:** Ensures all nodes agree on one ‚Äútrue‚Äù history of transactions (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.).
* **Immutable:** Once data is confirmed, altering it requires redoing all following work ‚Üí practically impossible.

---

### **5. Smart Contract Platform**

* **Definition:** A blockchain with an execution environment (EVM, WASM, etc.) for running smart contracts.
* **Examples:** Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Near.
* **Key feature:** Provides a **virtual machine** + APIs to developers so they can deploy contracts.

---

### **6. The Oracle Problem**

* **Technical issue:** Blockchains are **closed systems**. They can only process on-chain data ‚Üí they cannot directly call an API, read a website, or fetch real-world information.
* **Reason:** All nodes must reach consensus deterministically. If each node fetched data from the internet, results might differ ‚Üí consensus breaks.

---

### **7. Oracles**

* **Definition:** Middleware that fetches off-chain data and feeds it into the blockchain.
* **Types:**

  * **Inbound oracles**: Real-world ‚Üí blockchain (e.g., weather, prices).
  * **Outbound oracles**: Blockchain ‚Üí real-world (e.g., smart contract triggers IoT device).
* **Trust problem:** Oracles themselves could lie or fail ‚Üí they need to be decentralized too.

---

### **8. Hybrid Smart Contracts**

* **Definition:** Contracts that use both **on-chain logic** + **off-chain computation/data** through oracles.
* **Workflow:**

  * On-chain: stores rules, funds, state.
  * Off-chain: fetches data or does heavy computation.
* **Example:** DeFi insurance ‚Üí on-chain contract locks premiums, off-chain oracle provides weather/flood data.

---

### **9. Chainlink**

* **Technical role:** A **decentralized oracle network (DON)**.
* **How it works:** Multiple independent oracle nodes fetch data from APIs, aggregate results, and deliver a verified data feed on-chain.
* **Example:** Chainlink Price Feeds (ETH/USD, BTC/USD) ‚Üí used in lending protocols to determine collateral value.

---

### **10. Layer 2 (L2) Scaling**

* **Problem:** Base layer (Ethereum L1) is slow and expensive due to limited throughput.
* **Solution:** Execute transactions off-chain (Layer 2), then batch results back to L1 for security.

**Types:**

1. **Optimistic Rollups**

   * Assume transactions are valid by default.
   * Fraud-proof window: if someone cheats, others can submit a proof.
   * Example: Optimism, Arbitrum.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)**

   * Generate a **cryptographic proof** (zero-knowledge proof) showing transactions are valid.
   * Proof is verified on L1 ‚Üí no need to replay transactions.
   * Example: zkSync, StarkNet.

---

### **11. Decentralized Application (dApp) & Protocol**

* **dApp:**

  * Frontend (HTML/JS like normal apps).
  * Backend = smart contracts on blockchain.
  * Example: Uniswap dApp for token swapping.

* **Protocol:**

  * The underlying set of smart contracts and rules.
  * Example: Uniswap‚Äôs automated market maker (AMM) protocol defines how liquidity pools and swaps work.

---

### **12. Web3**

* **Technically:** A stack of technologies built around **blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized identity.**
* **Core features:**

  * Users own their assets (private keys control crypto, NFTs).
  * Applications are open and composable (anyone can build on top of existing protocols).
  * Identity = wallets instead of emails/passwords.
* **Example stack:**

  * L1 blockchain (Ethereum).
  * L2 scaling (Arbitrum, zkSync).
  * dApps (Uniswap, OpenSea).
  * Wallets (MetaMask).
