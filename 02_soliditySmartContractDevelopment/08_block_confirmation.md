You’ve got the right **overall idea**—your transaction sits in **one block**, and then **more blocks are added on top of it**—but a couple of details about *who* adds those next blocks need a small correction:

---

### What really happens

1. **Your transaction is proposed and included**

   * A single validator proposes a block that contains your transaction.
   * That block is accepted and becomes part of the canonical chain.

2. **Subsequent blocks are produced**

   * After that, **each new block is proposed by a different validator** chosen by Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake protocol.
   * These validators don’t “sign off” on your transaction one by one.
   * They are simply doing their normal job of producing the next block of network activity.

3. **Confirmations are automatic**

   * Every time another block is successfully appended, your transaction is said to have **one more confirmation**.
   * So if you see “5 confirmations,” it means five *separate* blocks—created by five *different* validator turns—have been added after the block that contains your transaction.

---

### Key clarification

It isn’t “4 validators giving approval” to your specific transaction.
Instead, it’s **4 different validators each adding the next block**, and those blocks **indirectly confirm** everything that came before.

---

✅ **Summary in one line**
Your transaction is finalized in *one* block; then as **other validators take their turns creating subsequent blocks**, each new block adds one more confirmation that your transaction is permanently part of the Ethereum blockchain.

When you check the same transaction later, the **number of confirmations will usually be higher** because the blockchain keeps growing.

**Why this happens**

1. **Your transaction’s block is fixed**

   * Suppose your transaction is in block **#10,000,000**.

2. **The chain keeps adding blocks**

   * New blocks—10,000,001, 10,000,002, …—are produced roughly every 12 seconds.

3. **Confirmation count = current chain height – your block number + 1**

   * If the chain height is 10,000,007, your transaction now shows **8 confirmations**.

So when you refresh the Etherscan page after a few minutes, the confirmation number will have increased because **more blocks have been added on top of the one that contains your transaction**, making it even more secure and irreversible.

No—your transaction isn’t split across five blocks at all.
On Ethereum (and other blockchains) a single transaction lives entirely inside one block.
Here’s how it really works:


---

1️⃣ Your transaction is mined/validated once

When you send a transaction, it sits in the mempool (the waiting area).

A validator picks it up and includes it in one specific block—let’s call that Block N.

All the data for that transaction is stored completely inside Block N.



---

2️⃣ Confirmations are just extra layers of security

After Block N is finalized, the network keeps producing new blocks: N+1, N+2, …

Each new block is another confirmation that Block N is part of the permanent chain.

So when Etherscan shows 5 confirmations, it means: Block N + 5 more blocks have been added on top of it.



---

3️⃣ Nothing is “split”

Your transaction isn’t broken into pieces or distributed across those five blocks.

Those later blocks don’t contain parts of your transaction; they just build on top of the block that already contains it.



---

Quick analogy:
Think of pouring concrete:

You pour your slab once (your transaction in Block N).

Each extra layer of concrete above it (later blocks) makes the foundation harder to tamper with.

The original slab never gets chopped up.


✅ Bottom line:
Your Ethereum transaction is written to one block only.
The “5 block confirmations” simply show that five more blocks have been added after that block, making your transaction increasingly irreversible.
